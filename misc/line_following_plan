    Internal state:
        * Left error signal
        * Right error signal
        * Turn in progress
        * Lost turning line
        * Speed
        * How long since we last saw a line?
        * Which way was the line?
            - Already stored in the error variable

    Follow a straight line:
        * Outer left, inner left, inner right, outer right :- 0=no line, 1=line
        * 0110
            We are okay! Keep driving forwards.
        * 0010
            Have veered a little left, compensate
        * 0100
            Have veered a little right, compensate
        * 1110
            Found a left turn
        * 0111
            Found a right turn
        * 1111
            Found both turns
        * 0000
            If it has been a long time since we saw a line, LOST
            Otherwise correct towards the last known direction
        * 1000
            Have veered a lot right, compensate
        * 0001
            Have veered a lot left, compensate
        * 1100, 0011, 1001, 1011, 1101, 0101, 1010
            What on earth happened?! Drive straight and hope we get
            into a normal state soon. Slow down, too, because of the
            impending collision. With the wall. In front of us.

    Turning (left or right):
        * 0110
            If we haven't yet lost the line: continue starting to turn
            Otherwise: We've finished the turn
        * x10x and x01x
            If we haven't yet lost the line, turning is going as expected.
            Otherwise, we have found the line again, ACTION_FINISHED
        * 0000
            If we hadn't lost the line yet, we now have.
            Keep applying turning steering.
        * Other states
            Something is going wrong, keep applying steering and hope it
            fixes itself.

    Turning around (clockwise or counterclockwise):
        As above but drive motors in full diffential. :(
